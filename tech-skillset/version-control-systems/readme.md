# Version Control System (VCS)

A **Version Control System** tracks changes in your project or files.

It lets you:
- See what changed from older versions  
- Go back to previous versions  
- Collaborate with others  

In coding, we don’t want to lose work — we may need to revert our changes or restore older versions.

# Git

**Git** is:
- Fast  
- Works offline  
- Supported by most major version control platforms (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)  
- Free and open-source
